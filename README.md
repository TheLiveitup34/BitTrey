- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to display. This is the app's **Graphical User Interface**.
- `js/app.js` - A script to read and render the webpage **renderer process**.
- `js/api.js` - Api comunication to comunicate with the database.
- `js/vaildator.js` - Validate forms and submits to the api for comunication.
- `js/storage.js` - Allows for a local Storage System.
